# Card-Game

  The goal of this project is to implement a card game, which the user can remove the card from the top of the deck

    - Start the code
    - Add card numbers
    - Once added, the user can ask to print the receipt
    - The program can also remove the top of the card from the deck

## Project Goals

  This function will take the user's input and store it in a list.

  **Preconditions:**
  
      - item can NOT be a negative integer, or a word, letter
      - "done" will give the final output
      - "q" will quit the program
      - "r" prints the stack
      - "t" takesd the top card from the stack

## Future Improvements

  **1. Remove Items:** 
  
    - Introduce a remove items feature, in further detail,which can remove more than one card or specific cards.

  **2. Different Cards:** 
  
    - Allow user to type in cards, and possible specifiy which type, such as an ace of spades, with a symbol.
